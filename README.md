# JinShop
Fun and efficient `Python/Flask` based ItemShop for Minecraft.
Jinja2 templating system and easy to understand coding will help you
modify and set this shop to your own preferences.

##### Keep in mind that JinShop is NOT finished.

##### It lacks in many aspects and it DOESN'T work properly yet.

### Features (or upcoming features)
- Python/Flask based (fun and efficient)
- Control Panel for administrators
- Account creation for users (so they don't need to put theirs nickname everytime they buy something)
- Full and safe registration and logging system
- Recovering password in case of losing it (and email sending)
- Full shop offer creation system
- MicroSMS support (more in the future)
- Decent design ready to extend
- Many databases available (`SQLAlchemy` supports few big databases)
- BCrypt hashing, and Vigenere encryption support
- ReCaptcha and `WTForms` support
- Bootstrap 4.x based
- Vouchers
- More to come (probably)!

### Why bothering to create new ItemShop when there's so many?
I challanged one of my friends to write similar ItemShop
in Java/Spring technology. He doesn't even started yet, so
I guess I'm winning :)

Remember that this shop **WILL NOT** be better than current
alternatives like for example **BuyCraft** which is awesome.
This is for people looking for open-source project that they can
use for fast prototyping their own itemshop system.

### Why Flask?
Flask provides simplicity and flexibility.
It's super easy to understand and modify.
It's also one of the fastest out there.
That's why I chose it. It lets you focus on the
coding, not learning the framework.

It is used by the biggest companies in the world
like **Netflix, Instagram, and Lyft**

### How can I use it?
Currently I do not recommend `using` it.
I would recommend playing with it and testing.

It's definitely not ready for production.

### When it will be finished?
I guess few more days, I really like the concept
and I would really like to finish it. Then, I will probably
return to writing OpenSectors2. :)
